Unity NAT Facilitator for FreeBSD

WHAT
Unity's NAT Facilitator (which is basically Raknet's) doesn't compile on FreeBSD because Raknet is crap.

This fixes the raknet files to have them actually compile.

HOWTO

Just "make"

LICENSE

The original project is license-less, raknet is GPLv3, so I guess this has to be GPLv3 as well? Who cares, do what you want, as long as it doesn't involve murdering children or something.
