Unity NAT Facilitator (for *nix)

WHAT

Unity's NAT Facilitator (which is basically Raknet's) doesn't compile on FreeBSD because Raknet is crap.
This fixes the raknet files to have them actually compile.
I also took the liberty to try and fix the gagillion warnings that G++ complains about, because the Raknet codebase is really a nightmare.

HOWTO

Just "make"
"make install" will put the executable file in /usr/local/bin

EXTRA

freebsd.service is a FreeBSD rc.d service so you can run it a boot time or stop it when running as deamon

LICENSE

The original project is license-less, raknet is GPLv3, so I guess this has to be GPLv3 as well? Who cares, do what you want, as long as it doesn't involve murdering children or something.
