Unity NAT Facilitator for FreeBSD

WHAT
Unity's NAT Facilitator (which is basically Raknet's) doesn't compile on FreeBSD because FreeBSD uses a patched raknet or something. Also Unity likes outdated raknet for some reason.

This is a stripped out version that uses the Raknet from ports (devel/raknet) and works with the latest raknet.

HOWTO

1. Install devel/raknet from ports
   DO NOT CLEAN THE WORK FOLDER AFTER INSTALLATION

2. Go into the work folder (probably /usr/ports/devel/raknet/work) and do:
       make RakNetDynamic
       cp Lib/DLL/libRakNetDynamic.so /usr/local/lib

3. Go back into the repo's folder and do
       make

4. You're done, just call ./Facilitator and you're all set!
   (use ./Facilitator --help for cmd line parameters)

LICENSE

The original project is license-less, raknet is GPLv3, so I guess this has to be GPLv3 as well? Who cares, do what you want, as long as it doesn't involve murdering children or something.
